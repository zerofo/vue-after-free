## Non-Jailbroken PS4
  1. Format your USB Drive to Exfat. 
> [!WARNING]
> This will wipe your drive of all data. Backup any important data. 
  2. Download the SystemBackup.zip from Releases.
  3. Unpack the contents of the zip onto the USB.
  4. Plug the USB into your console. 
  5. If you have a real PSN account on the console go to Settings>Application Saved Data Management>Saved Data in System Storage and backup your savedata to the USB. (Sufficient space required.)
  * If you cannot access the savedata you do not have a Real PSN account or fake activated account, meaning that if you do not jailbreak first you cannot backup your saves.
  6. Go to Settings>Storage>System Storage>Capture Gallery>All and backup your captures to the USB. (Sufficient space required.)
  7. Go to Settings>System>Back Up and Restore>Restore PS4 and select the the system backup there and restore it.

  * User account ID is "1111111111111111" you cannot change it but you can create another user and fake activate it, then while jailbroken follow the instructions above for jailbroken users to set up PS Vue while signed into the newly activated account.

# Connecting to the internet. 
  1. Navigate to Settings > System > Automatic Downloads, and uncheck "Featured Content", "System Software Update Files" and "Application Update Files".
  2. Navigate to Settings > Network > Check Connect to the Internet, then Set Up Internet Connection.

  8. Primary DNS: 62.210.38.117 (Leave the secondary blank as it is)
  9. MTU Settings: Automatic
  10. Proxy Server: Do Not Use
  11. Test the internet connection if you get an IP address it's working. 
  * The internet connection failing does not indicate that it actually cannot connect to the internet, it just means the PS4 cannot communicate with Sony servers which is the point of the DNS


# Payloads
Vue After Free comes preloaded with some payloads. 

### NP-Fake-SignIn
The np-fake-signin payload gets rid of the first PS Vue pop-up asking you to sign into PSN. 
In the payloads section of Vue, you will see np-fake-signin-ps4-vue.elf and np-fake-signin-ps4-user.elf. 
np-fake-signin-ps4-vue.elf should only be used if you are using the system backup provided on this repo. 
np-fake-signin-ps4-user.elf should be used for any other fake activated user account. 

## FTP 
The ftp-server.ts payload gives you sandbox FTP to quickly swap exploit or cosmetic files without running a kernel exploit/jailbreaking.

## WebUI
Example code for how you can run userland code with webkit as the ui. (possible alternative to jsmaf)

## ELFLDR
elfldr.elf is used to load elf and bin payloads post exploit when HEN or GoldHEN have not been loaded. 

## AIOFIX 
This elf file is automatically loaded when the lapse kernel exploit has executed successfully it fixes issues in some games. It is not needed for poopsploit/netctrl.
